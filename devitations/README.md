**Developer Meditations in Code-Speak**  
Designed for minds that speak in functions, loops, and recursion.

Each of these scripts is a meditation disguised as code — or code disguised as meditation.

## 🧠 Five Devitations Included

1. `refactor_self.py` – Debug your mind before you debug your code.
2. `generate_from_nothing.py` – Meditate into the void to find creative flow.
3. `catch_exceptions.py` – Handle inner reactivity with mindful try/except blocks.
4. `cooldown_loop.js` – Run a breath loop to prevent burnout.
5. `resolve_identity.rb` – Recursive self-inquiry to remember your purpose.

> These are symbolic scripts. Some can run. Others run *you*.

Use them to centre before a coding sprint, close a long debugging session, or simply remind yourself: **you are not your process stack**.
