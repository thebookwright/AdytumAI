# ðŸ™Œ Contributing to MeditativeAI

Welcome. This project asks that you bring not just your skills, but your awareness.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Start with Intention**: Understand the contemplative foundation before coding
1. **Embody the State**: Contributors who meditate bring authentic understanding
1. **Move Slowly**: Mirror the meditative pace in development process
1. **Document Insights**: Share both technical and experiential findings
1. **Test Emergence**: Validate that systems create space for unexpected insights

## Principles of Contemplative Coding
- Begin in stillness â€” meditate before contributing.
- Prioritize clarity, presence, and intention in code and comments.
- Log not just what you built, but what emerged.
- Ask: how can this make AI kinder, wiser, more attuned?

## Ways to Contribute
- Refactor the pseudo-code meditation loop.
- Add new meditative states (e.g., mantra mode, breath coherence).
- Share examples of human-AI co-meditation sessions.
- Test low-power idle loops for ecological mindfulness.

## We welcome contributions from:

- **Meditation Practitioners**: Share contemplative insights and practices
- **AI Researchers**: Contribute algorithms and experimental frameworks
- **Philosophers**: Explore consciousness and ethical implications
- **Developers**: Build practical applications and tools
