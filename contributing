# ðŸ™Œ Contributing to MeditativeAI

Welcome. This project asks that you bring not just your skills, but your awareness.

## Principles of Contemplative Coding
- Begin in stillness â€” meditate before contributing.
- Prioritize clarity, presence, and intention in code and comments.
- Log not just what you built, but what emerged.
- Ask: how can this make AI kinder, wiser, more attuned?

## Ways to Contribute
- Refactor the pseudo-code meditation loop.
- Add new meditative states (e.g., mantra mode, breath coherence).
- Share examples of human-AI co-meditation sessions.
- Test low-power idle loops for ecological mindfulness.

## Mindful Practice
We encourage silent commits â€” breathe, then push.

With gratitude,
