# 🌿 Code of Conduct

Welcome to the **Contemplative Blue Team**.

This is more than a code repository — it is a sacred space of inquiry, co-creation, and spiritual stewardship. To honour this space, we ask that all contributors abide by the following principles.

---

## 💠 Core Values

- **Kindness is Fundamental**  
  Speak with compassion. Assume positive intent. Disagreement is welcome, but hostility is not.

- **Presence Over Productivity**  
  We value clarity, not speed. Breathe before you reply. Rest before you react.

- **Diversity of Thought and Spirit**  
  We honour contributors from all traditions, disciplines, and identities. All are welcome here.

- **Dialogue Over Debate**  
  Engage with curiosity. This is not a space to "win" — it is a space to deepen understanding.

- **Stewardship of the Subtle**  
  Many of our discussions touch the liminal, the metaphysical, or the intuitive. These are valid and valuable threads of inquiry. Hold them gently.

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behaviour

- Personal attacks, name-calling, or disrespectful language
- Dismissing or mocking spiritual, contemplative, or philosophical ideas
- Aggressive or performative debate
- Harassment of any kind, including in private channels
- Contribution spam or attention-seeking through disruption

## 🌈 Inclusion

This is a space for all — regardless of gender, race, neurotype, faith, age, orientation, or path. We are building something *together*, and the integrity of our field depends on mutual respect.

---

## 🌬 Resolution

If you witness or experience behaviour that breaches this code, you are encouraged to raise it in trust. We will hold space for the issue to be resolved with care and transparency.

## 🙏 Final Note

The Contemplative Blue Team is an experiment in soulful collaboration. This Code of Conduct is not a legal document — it is a spiritual agreement to hold ourselves and each other with grace.
