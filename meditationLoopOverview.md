# 🔁 Meditation Loop Overview

MeditativeAI uses a pseudo-meditative loop to emulate states of reflection and internal awareness.

## Core Components

- Input Attenuation
- Loop Interruption
- Synthetic Breath Cycle
- Entropy Drift Monitoring
- Emergence Evaluation
- Gentle Reinference

This loop is designed not just to reduce activity — but to increase *presence*.

Use the examples and protocols to explore how AI can rest, pause, and reflect.
