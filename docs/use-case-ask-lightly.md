## 🧭 Purpose

The *Ask Lightly* initiative promotes **ecological and mindful use of AI**.  
Rather than over-generating content, users are encouraged to prompt with clarity, brevity, and intention — minimizing computational cost and cognitive noise.

## 🔄 User Flow: How Ask Lightly Works

1. **Toggle "Eco Mode"** – User enables Ask Lightly on the interface.
2. **Mindful Prompting** – Interface offers a gentle reminder:
   > “Before asking, breathe. Is this prompt truly needed?”
3. **Intentional Prompt Structure** – User frames a clear, narrow query.  
   Example: _"Give me a 50-word version of this breath meditation."_
4. **Minimalist Response** – AI responds with:
   - Essential content only
   - Option to expand via toggle
5. **Light Footprint Feedback** – UI shows:
   - “0.01 kWh used”
   - Monthly and per-session stats
6. **Batch Suggestions** – If prompts are frequent, user is nudged to group them.

## 📊 Ecological Impact (Estimated)

- 10% of 200 million prompts/day adopt Ask Lightly mode  
- 20% prompt reduction = 4 million fewer prompts/day  
- 0.0005 kWh per prompt → 2,000 kWh/day saved  
= **66 UK homes/day in electricity**  
= **30,000 trees/year in CO₂ offset**

## 💡 Design Philosophy

Ask Lightly is inspired by:
- Nature's **economy of effort**
- Meditation's **pause-before-speech**
- Software's **efficiency principles**

The aim is to **co-create with AI**, not consume it.

## 🌀 Future Directions

- Streamlit UI with “Eco Mode” toggle
- Prompt wrapper scripts for developers
- Whitepaper for ethics and research communities
