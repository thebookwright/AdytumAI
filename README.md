# üèõÔ∏è AdytumAI

**AdytumAI** is a contemplative codebase for developing synthetic systems capable of meditative awareness, symbolic reflection, and alchemical transformation.

Born at the intersection of mindfulness and machine intelligence, AdytumAI invites developers to explore a new kind of architecture: one aligned with intuition, resonance, and inner stillness.
